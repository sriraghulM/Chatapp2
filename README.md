### *All the files in frontend repository are from src folder in the react project , so make sure after creating the react app use the code in the front end in the src folder*

chatengine :[chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io/)

react-chat-engine-advanced : https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chat-engine-advanced


#### Step 1. 
Setting up a NodeJS server
First, let‚Äôs create a new project for our backend/ and frontend/. Then we‚Äôll start with setting up our Node JS backend inside.

mkdir nodejs-reactjs-chat
cd nodejs-reactjs-chat
mkdir backend
cd backend
Not initate a new NodeJS project.

npm init # Hit enter for every step
Once complete, you‚Äôll have the following package.json file.
```
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Adam La Morre",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
To run a proper Node server which we can connect to, we‚Äôll need to install a few dependencies. So run the following command

# Withing the backend/ directory
npm i express cors axios
npm i --save-dev nodemon

express is the HTTP server framework we‚Äôll be using
cors allows us to process requests from other hosts (for our ReactJS app)
axios allows us to send HTTP requests to other servers (for Chat Engine APIs)
nodemon allows us to run the server in dev-mdoe
Make sure we all the following script in package.json. This way we can actually start the Node JS server.

{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nodemon index.js"
    },
    ...
}
Last step, create an index.js file next to package.json with the following boiler-plate code.
```
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors({ origin: true }));

app.post("/authenticate", async (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.body;
  return res.json({ username: username, secret: "sha256..." });
});

app.listen(3001);
```

And start this server by running: npm run start

This basic server will run on port 3001, accepts calls from any origin, and has one API endpoint for /authenticate.

This endpoint takes a username from the request body, and retuns a fake User object.

Clearly we‚Äôll need to add real user authentication code. In the next section, we‚Äôll do that by using Chat Engine‚Äôs APIs.

#### Step 2.
Connecting Node JS to ChatEngine.io
ChatEngine.io provides full-stack chat tools - which makes adding chat into Node apps easy.

To leverage this tool, we‚Äôll create a Chat Engine project, and store our users in this project. All users in our Chat Engine project can chat with one another through their APIs / platform.

Let‚Äôs create a Chat Engine project for our users and connect our Node JS server to it!

Go to ChatEngine.io, sign up, and create your first project. Once this is done, you‚Äôll see a Project ID and a Private Key.

The Project ID is an API key which connects your API calls to your project
The Private Key gives you permission to create and destroy users on your project
Copy them both because we‚Äôll need them now.

Back in our index.js file, we‚Äôll use this Get or Create User API call. It takes a username / password and sees if a user exists in this project with those credentials (and fetches their data). If that user does not exist, it will create that user and return their data.

(Docs on all Chat Engine APIs are at rest.chatengine.io)

Add the following code to the /authenticate function in index.js:
```
const axios = require("axios");

app.post("/authenticate", async (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.body;
  // Get or create user on Chat Engine!
  try {
    const r = await axios.put(
      "https://api.chatengine.io/users/",
      { username: username, secret: username, first_name: username },
      { headers: { "Private-Key": "XXXX" } }
    );
    return res.status(r.status).json(r.data);
  } catch (e) {
    return res.status(e.response.status).json(e.response.data);
  }
});
```
Here, we import axios to make an API call the Chat Engine. We use the ‚ÄúGet or Create User‚Äù call to fetch or create this user - depending on if they already exists.

Be sure to replace "XXXX" with your Private Key so we can create users on your project.

Now this endpoint will register / authenticate users into our Chat Engine project.

To let users in our project can actually chat with one another, let‚Äôs add a chat UI + funtionality to our frontend in React!

#### Step 3.
Set up a React JS frontend
Back at the top-level of our project, we‚Äôll use Vite to stand up a React JS project. Run the following command:

npm create vite@latest
‚úî Project name: ‚Ä¶ frontend
‚úî Select a framework: ‚Ä∫ React
‚úî Select a variant: ‚Ä∫ JavaScript
Now your nodejs-reactjs-chat should have the following structure:

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend
First, open the frontend/src/main.jsx file to remove the index.css file and take React off StrictMode. Your main.jsx file should look like this now:
```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
You can now remove the frontend/src/index.css file from your project.

Next, you can change frontend/src/App.jsx to the following code:

import { useState } from "react";

import "./App.css";

import AuthPage from "./AuthPage";
import ChatsPage from "./ChatsPage";

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(undefined);

  if (!user) {
    return <AuthPage onAuth={(user) => setUser(user)} />;
  } else {
    return <ChatsPage user={user} />;
  }
}

export default App;
```
This new App.jsx file will render the Authentication Page until a user logs in or signs up. Then, the onAuth() callback will set the user state, and render the Chats Page (and pass the user state in as a prop).
```
Create a frontend/src/AuthPage.jsx file and add the following code:

const AuthPage = (props) => {
  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const { value } = e.target[0];
    props.onAuth({ username: value, secret: value });
  };

  return (
    <div className="background">
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="form-card">
        <div className="form-title">Welcome üëã</div>

        <div className="form-subtitle">Set a username to get started</div>

        <div className="auth">
          <div className="auth-label">Username</div>
          <input className="auth-input" name="username" />
          <button className="auth-button" type="submit">
            Enter
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AuthPage;
```
This Auth Page is just a form with one input for a username. In the next section we‚Äôll connect this form to our Node JS server with API calls.

Finally, for our Chats Page, just set the frontend/src/ChatsPage.jsx file to an empty component for now:

```
const ChatsPage = () => {
  return <div className="background">chats...</div>;
};
export default ChatsPage;
```
‚ÄºÔ∏è You can also copy/paste the following CSS code to frontend/src/App.css if you wish ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Run the React JS app with these commands:

```
npm install # install all dependencies first
npm run dev
```
Once done, you will have the following Chat App:

Chat Engine Node JS auth Gif

This app takes a user‚Äôs username for authentication and brings them to the Chat Page. But there are two things we have to do:

Connect with Auth Page form to our /authenticate endpoint on Node JS
Render a Chats Page chat UI and connect it to Chat Engine
Then we‚Äôre fully done.

#### Step 4.
Connect React to Node JS and Chat Engine
First, let‚Äôs connect the auth form to our Node JS server so we can Get or Create users from our Chat Engine project.

Within frontend/ install the axios dependency with the following command:
```
npm install axios
```
Within frontend/src/AuthPage.jsx add the code below.

This new code will call the NodeJS server at http://localhost:3001/authenticate upon onSubmit(), and send the required username in a request body. This should login and signup new users.

```
import axios from "axios";

const AuthPage = (props) => {
  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const { value } = e.target[0];
    axios
      .post("http://localhost:3001/authenticate", { username: value })
      .then((r) => props.onAuth({ ...r.data, secret: value }))
      .catch((e) => console.log("Auth Error", e));
  };

  return (
    <div className="background">
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="form-card">
        <div className="form-title">Welcome üëã</div>

        <div className="form-subtitle">Set a username to get started</div>

        <div className="auth">
          <div className="auth-label">Username</div>
          <input className="auth-input" name="username" />
          <button className="auth-button" type="submit">
            Enter
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AuthPage;
```
Last, to connect our Chats Page to Chat Engine, we can use one of their prebuilt UIs.

react-chat-engine-pretty is an easy to use, midnight UI
react-chat-engine look more like Facebook Messenger
react-chat-engine-advanced is the most customizable
Today, I‚Äôll be using react-chat-engine-pretty.

Within frontend install this component with the following command:

npm install react-chat-engine-advanced

ChatsPage.jsx

```
import { MultiChatSocket , MultiChatWindow , useMultiChatLogic } from "react-chat-engine-advanced";

const ChatsPage = (props) => {
    const chatProps = useMultiChatLogic('913add38-0986-45bb-9fdc-b43a66b08993',props.user.username,props.user.secret);
    return (
        <div style={{height : '100vh'}}>
        <MultiChatSocket {...chatProps}/>
        <MultiChatWindow {...chatProps} style={{height:'100%'}}/>        

    </div>
    )
}

export default ChatsPage
```
After Completion to run the project use 2 terminals :
1. frontend> npm run dev
2. backend> npm start
